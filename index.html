  <h1>THIRD SOUTH CAPITAL</h1>

  <h2>Thesis</h2>
  <p>
    Much attention is paid to early-stage technology companies through
    deployment of venture capital and late-stage technology companies through
    deployment growth equity. Comparatively few firms are interested in the
    uncanny valley in between those two stages: healthy, profitable businesses
    that provide value for their customers and are poised to grow further with
    additional resourcing and domain expertise, even if they are unlikely to be
    the next billion dollar company (or even the next hundred million dollar
    company).
  </p>
  <p>We buy SaaS products or businesses which have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>$5k-$40k in MRR</li>
    <li>Clearly demonstrated product-market fit</li>
    <li>A stable or steadily growing revenue trajectory</li>
    <li>Low operational overhead</li>
    <li>
      Opportunities for further growth with investments in sales, marketing, and
      development
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You’ll be particularly interested in our partnership if you’re a founder or
    founding team who:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>is looking to transition out of direct, day-to-day management</li>
    <li>wants to find liquidity to fund a larger, more ambitious venture</li>
    <li>
      knows your company has room to grow, but its needs have outgrown your core
      competencies and interests
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>
    Our goal is to close transactions in less than sixty days, working with you
    to find a transaction structure that suits your goals.

                  <h2>Story</h2>
                  <p>
                    We are a team of three friends who enjoy the fun and challenge of owning and
                    growing interesting software products. Each of us lived in the same college
                    dorm on the top floor in the same section: Yates Third South.

                    in Yates, we have spent ten years separately honing specific expertises. No
                    team is perfect - and we certainly aren’t - but between us we have:
